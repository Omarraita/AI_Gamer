# Training notebook
You can find the main training notebook for DQN here "[here](https://github.com/Omarraita/AI_Gamer/blob/main/DQN/From%20pixels/Atari/AtariDQNTrain.ipynb)". This notebook can be used to train an agent on various games such as pong, breakout and pacman. 

A "[pretrained model](https://github.com/Omarraita/AI_Gamer/tree/main/DQN/From%20pixels/Atari/trainedmodels)" for pong is also available.

# Requirements
