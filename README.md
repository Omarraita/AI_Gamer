# Training notebook
You can find the main training notebook for DQN under (DQN/From pixels/Atari/AtariDQNTrain.py). This notebook can be used to train an agent on various games such as pong, breakout and pacman. 

A pretrained model for pong is also available (AI_Gamer/DQN/From pixels/Atari/trainedmodels/pong.ptm).

# Requirements
Install the version 1.2.1 of atari-py: 
'''
pip install --no-index -f https://github.com/Kojoley/atari-py/releases atari_py
'''
